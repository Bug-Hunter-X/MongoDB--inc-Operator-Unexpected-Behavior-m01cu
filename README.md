This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the MongoDB $inc operator. The bug arises from using $inc with a negative value when the target field is not present in the document or is already zero.  This can lead to incorrect updates and data inconsistencies. The solution shows the correct way to handle such scenarios, ensuring that the update operation behaves as expected.
